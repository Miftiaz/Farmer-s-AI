Team AgriVision

As part of our participation in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, we aimed to develop a solution focused on supporting farmers. To address their needs, we have already designed a user-friendly interface and the prototype link is attached. The next step—developing the full application—is currently in progress. Once the full app is developed, we will upload the source code.
